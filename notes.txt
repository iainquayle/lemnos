changes:
	guarenteed:
		look into using unet example, whether more compilation errors need to be recoverable
			ie, just attempt next transition
		create ir save and load, allowing for resuming of search
		make more tests for control and surrounding functionality
		refactor adapters
			break any mixed responsiblities 
			divide more naturally
		refactor mix conv
			maybe split it
		look into more flexible means of working with grouping
			even see if there would be any way to somewhat fit a square root curve, but still be solvable
	possible:
		add optional shape bounds to transitions, not to be conformed to but allow more flexibility in defining when to use transitions
		look into making a prescreening/heauristic filter step that allows more filtering of the space prior to model testing,
			will just toss the models
		make sample collection immutable?
		implement some kind of node ratio rules
			the search space for larger models needs to be brought down
		add a divisor option to the clamp val on shape bounds
		make it so the divisor lookahead doesnt take into account the nodes hint
		rename transitions to edges or something?
		move templates to jinja or the sort?
