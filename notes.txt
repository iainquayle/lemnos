changes:
	guarenteed:
		look at moving more functionality from the trackers to the joins
		add ease of life
			make mroe graph build checks, ie no merge method with multiple inputs
			make failed compilation logging
		refactor adapters
			rename generate_module and get_module
			break any mixed responsiblities 
			divide more naturally
	possible:
		move conformance to its own module, then allow components to pull it in
			perhaps put it under shared
			perhpas rename shared to shape, as that seems to be the only thing it holds
		add a divisor option to the clamp val on shape bounds
		make it so the divisor lookahead doesnt take into account the nodes hint
		rename transitions to edges or something?
		add explicit gc calls, memory issues when machine already in use
