changes:
	guarenteed:
		fix the issue with the groups
			create look ahead, that can define the modulo that a shape must conform to?
				already have look ahead for joining existing nodes nodes, so not unheard of
			also just refactor it
	possible:
		switch target module name to adapters, put framework specific code in there?
		remove validate transform shape
		make transforms return none if the output doesnt fit perfectly, ie 5 -> 2
		move ir to the target module
			keep the generation in the schema module
problems:
	issue with groups, the input shape needs to be divisible by the group size
		!! node already do a singular lookahead when it comes to finding a valid output shape for joining existing nodes
			so just make a singular lookahead for closest valid shapes, and then choose the one that is closest to the desired shape
			shouldnt be too hard to implement, as it would deal with all of the schema nodes in a transition that it owns
		if all else fails, or as a fall back, could technically implement padding

design:
	adapters
		allow this to work with any framework
		currently, using isinstance, but could use a nice approach
			look into the action/command? pattern and the visitor pattern, may provide some better structural ideas?
	start by making control specific to torch, but attempt to make it more generic later and accept an adapter
		adapter will use the source gen target and functions specific to the framework for training
		though this may be a dumb idea or atleast the sin of premature planning
