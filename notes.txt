features:
	implement the means of supplying the input shapes

changes:
	guarenteed:
		refactor adapters
			break any mixed responsiblities 
			divide more naturally
		make useful as library
			deal with model saving
			make more graph build checks, ie no merge method with multiple inputs
			make failed compilation logging
		refactor mix conv
			maybe split it
	possible:
		consider making the merging of sample collections to immutable, or just sample collections in general
		implement some kind of node ratio rules
			the search space for larger models needs to be brought down
		consider renaming the project 
		move conformance to its own module, then allow components to pull it in
			perhaps put it under shared
			perhpas rename shared to shape, as that seems to be the only thing it holds
		add a divisor option to the clamp val on shape bounds
		make it so the divisor lookahead doesnt take into account the nodes hint
		rename transitions to edges or something?
		move templates to jinja or the sort
			may atleast have some syntax highlighting then
problems:
