changes:
	guarenteed:
		make builder indices abstract
			make one version for building a specific model from on sequence only requiring index
			make one for mutation and iteration
	possible:
		move model builder back to schema
			seperate schema nodes and model nodes from schema and model
			could make methods on a schema to make nodes, simplifying the importation
		move all node components to a single file
			transforms, activations, regularizers
			simplify the importation
		turn join existing into enum
			three: join on, make new, auto

problems:
	no hint as to why a schema is not solvable
	if a join existing is set where there is none to join on, it will crash with no reason
