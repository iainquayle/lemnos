changes:
	guarenteed:
		refactor adapters
			break any mixed responsiblities 
			divide more naturally
		rename formats to templates
	possible:
		move conformance to its own module, then allow components to pull it in
			perhaps put it under shared
			perhpas rename shared to shape, as that seems to be the only thing it holds
		add a divisor option to the clamp val on shape bounds
		make it so the divisor lookahead doesnt take into account the nodes hint
		rename transitions to edges or something?
		add explicit gc calls, memory issues when machine already in use 
		probably rename ID just to uint
