changes:
	guarenteed:
		deal with time and epochs in metrics
		refactor adapters
			break any mixed responsiblities 
			divide more naturally
		make useful as library
			clean requirements and reinstall
			deal with model saving
			rename src 
			make mroe graph build checks, ie no merge method with multiple inputs
			make failed compilation logging
		refactor mix conv
			maybe split it
	possible:
		should the control just be moved to schema???
			it does somewhat make sense, as the entire process is centered around the schema
		implement some kind of node ratio rules
			the search space for larger models needs to be brought down
		perhaps make breed indices hold IDs instead of nodes
			then move these over to control? 
			it is somewhat a control owned process, but not at the same time? idk
		consider renaming the project 
		move conformance to its own module, then allow components to pull it in
			perhaps put it under shared
			perhpas rename shared to shape, as that seems to be the only thing it holds
		add a divisor option to the clamp val on shape bounds
		make it so the divisor lookahead doesnt take into account the nodes hint
		rename transitions to edges or something?
		add explicit gc calls, memory issues when machine already in use 
		move templates to jinja or the sort
			may atleast have some syntax highlighting then
problems:
