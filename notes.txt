changes:
	guarenteed:
		impl max pool
		need to fix max and min loss
		look into more flexible means of working with grouping
			even see if there would be any way to somewhat fit a square root curve, but still be solvable
			put in different branch
			idea for conv sqrt groups, group based on the max of the input or output channels, or just have different grouping types
			this may allow for the removal of the divisor hint, maybe, would be nice 
		remove jank logging system in torch evaluator add proper user defined logging call back
		review whther more work can be done together with the conformance gathering and tracker mutation passes
			ie, caching the conformance gathering information and use it for tracker mutation if valid
		create ir save and load, allowing for resuming of search
		make tests for breeding
		refactor adapters
			break any mixed responsiblities 
			divide more naturally
		refactor mix conv
			maybe split it
		make possible call back for prescreening, allows for selecting models that only have certain node ratios
	possible:
		may be the case that mutable priorities are not actually needed? since it pops the top of the stack in any case
			check this on Unet example
		add optional shape bounds to transitions, not to be conformed to but allow more flexibility in defining when to use transitions
			may need to make "add group" take an explicit iterable instead of a arg list
			it seems to always be possible to work around, but would be easier to not
		make sample collection immutable?
		add a divisor option to the clamp val on shape bounds
		make it so the divisor lookahead doesnt take into account the nodes hint
		rename transitions to edges or something?
		move templates to jinja or the sort?
