changes:
	guarenteed:
		refactor and clean up schema
			make specific copy for recursion
				make the depth auto increment, and be a parameter?
		change name of range and move to transforms
	possible:
		turn join existing into enum
			three: join on, make new, auto
		change bound name to shape bound
		make transforms return none if the output doesnt fit perfectly, ie 5 -> 2
problems:
	no hint as to why a schema is not solvable
	if a join existing is set where there is none to join on, it will crash with no reason
