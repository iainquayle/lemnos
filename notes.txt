changes:
	guarenteed:
		create ir save and load, allowing for resuming of search
		make more tests for control and surrounding functionality
		refactor adapters
			break any mixed responsiblities 
			divide more naturally
		refactor mix conv
			maybe split it
		look into more flexible means of working with grouping
			even see if there would be any way to somewhat fit a square root curve, but still be solvable
	possible:
		make it so that errors are recovered from in compilation? just attempt next transition?
			not sure if this is necessary to expand valid graphs or just a crutch
		make sample collection immutable?
		implement some kind of node ratio rules
			the search space for larger models needs to be brought down
		add a divisor option to the clamp val on shape bounds
		make it so the divisor lookahead doesnt take into account the nodes hint
		rename transitions to edges or something?
		move templates to jinja or the sort?
