lookahead will be required to make a larger portion of pattern graphs create valid outputs
as of right now, technically the system will do a lookahead of one node, but to a limited extent, it does not take into account bounds
in order to take into account both, further back in the pattern, an older idea will need to be brought back
preprocessing of the pattern graph:
	it will need to be walked, and have the merge points logged in nodes above
	hard to do even then, as it will need to take into account whether a path ahead still has the ability to change the shape in the correct direction
all of this doesnt necessarily need to be done right away,
	as it is a real issue mainly around identity functions when combined with bounds
	and when an identity function comes to an add merge that has already had one parent
