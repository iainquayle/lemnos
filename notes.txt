changes:
	guarenteed:
		refactorings:
			clean namings
				make divisors clearer, ir proposed divisors
				transitions to edges perhaps
				functions surrounding compilation
				sampel collection to results sample?
				linear growth to perhaps scaling
			attempt to clean up divior checks, make them more self explanitory and hardened
			adapters, split up and fix any naming
			split conv and mix conv
			fix jank in sample collection
		impl max pool
		remove jank logging system in torch evaluator add proper user defined logging call back
		create ir save and load, allowing for resuming of search
		make tests for breeding
		impl a screening on the ir, allow for culling initial bad models
	possible:
		review whther more work can be done together with the conformance gathering and tracker mutation passes
			ie, caching the conformance gathering information and use it for tracker mutation if valid
		may be the case that mutable priorities are not actually needed? since it pops the top of the stack in any case
			check this on Unet example
		add optional shape bounds to transitions, not to be conformed to but allow more flexibility in defining when to use transitions
			may need to make "add group" take an explicit iterable instead of a arg list
			it seems to always be possible to work around, but would be easier to not
		add a divisor option to the clamp val on shape bounds
		rename transitions to edges or something?
		move templates to jinja or the sort?
