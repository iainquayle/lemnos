changes:
	guarenteed:
		fix the issue with the groups
			create look ahead, that can define the modulo that a shape must conform to?
				already have look ahead for joining existing nodes nodes, so not unheard of
			also just refactor it
	possible:
		remove validate transform shape
		make transforms return none if the output doesnt fit perfectly, ie 5 -> 2
		make ir hold the components of the schema rather than the schema itself
			also take out the index out of the ir
			and output those two items in a seperate list for breeding purposes
problems:
	issue with groups, the input shape needs to be divisible by the group size
		!! node already do a singular lookahead when it comes to finding a valid output shape for joining existing nodes
			so just make a singular lookahead for closest valid shapes, and then choose the one that is closest to the desired shape
			shouldnt be too hard to implement, as it would deal with all of the schema nodes in a transition that it owns
		if all else fails, or as a fall back, could technically implement padding
