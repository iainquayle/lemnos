changes:
	guarenteed:
		make builder indices abstract
			make one version for building a specific model from on sequence only requiring index
			make one for mutation and iteration
		move away from using magic functions where not required
			number of instances where the magic function's use is not clearly defined by its name
		change name of range and move to transforms
	possible:
		move model builder back to schema
			seperate schema nodes and model nodes from schema and model
			could make methods on a schema to make nodes, simplifying the importation
		move all node components to a single file
			transforms, activations, regularizers
			simplify the importation
		turn join existing into enum
			three: join on, make new, auto
		make open shape return -1 for 0
			could also make a methods get and get_upper and get_reverse
		change bound name to shape bound

problems:
	no hint as to why a schema is not solvable
	if a join existing is set where there is none to join on, it will crash with no reason
