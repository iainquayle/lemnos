changes:
	guarenteed:
		refactorings:
			clean namings
				make divisors clearer, ir proposed divisors
				transitions to edges perhaps
				functions surrounding compilation
				linear growth to perhaps scaling
			attempt to clean up divior checks, make them more self explanitory and hardened
				would it be possible to set it up such that a new joining node fix divisor problems casued by a previous one?
					think this may fuck up the ability to make the current divisor
					because suppose that what is needed is 8x+3 to get it to 8y..., but the current will need a grouping of 8x
				comp right now
					ideal output shape < input, open conformance, index //full get shape, but 
					conformance from group < sibling outputs, ideal proposed output, index
						aggregate conformance < input, new proposed output, index
					true output shape < input, conformance, index
			adapters, split up and fix any naming
			split conv and mix conv
			fix jank in sample collection
			add vertical spacing to code, looks fine in nvim but vsc is disgusting
		impl max pool
		make tests for breeding
		impl a screening on the ir, allow for culling on structural heuristics
	possible:
		review whther more work can be done together with the conformance gathering and tracker mutation passes
			ie, caching the conformance gathering information and use it for tracker mutation if valid
		may be the case that mutable priorities are not actually needed? since it pops the top of the stack in any case
			check this on Unet example
		add optional shape bounds to transitions, not to be conformed to but allow more flexibility in defining when to use transitions
			may need to make "add group" take an explicit iterable instead of a arg list
			it seems to always be possible to work around, but would be easier to not
		add a divisor option to the clamp val on shape bounds
		rename transitions to edges or something?
		move templates to jinja or the sort?
