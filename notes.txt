changes:
	guarenteed:
		fix the issue with the groups
			create look ahead, that can define the modulo that a shape must conform to?
				already have look ahead for joining existing nodes nodes, so not unheard of
			also just refactor it
		switch on component, and pull out information from the component
			solution for converting ir not pretty, but allows for extendsiblity while not adding additional complexity
			aswell, likely make any interface class that allows the additiong of new types of modules, be specific to the framework 
				ie, rather than having a generic component to str, make a torch specific one, allowing for the intricacies needed
			all that needs to happen at the end of the day is for the ir to be converted to a string which can be executed
			obviously allows for malicous code, but this is a user beware 
	possible:
		remove validate transform shape
		make transforms return none if the output doesnt fit perfectly, ie 5 -> 2
		move ir to the target module
			keep the generation in the schema module
problems:
	issue with groups, the input shape needs to be divisible by the group size
		!! node already do a singular lookahead when it comes to finding a valid output shape for joining existing nodes
			so just make a singular lookahead for closest valid shapes, and then choose the one that is closest to the desired shape
			shouldnt be too hard to implement, as it would deal with all of the schema nodes in a transition that it owns
		if all else fails, or as a fall back, could technically implement padding
